## 👋 What's next
I created this polished README draft and prepared a suggested commit. If you want, I can:
- generate individual READMEs for each project (with badges, screenshots and usage steps),
- include demo images or GIFs (you can upload them to each repo),
- try to commit this file for you (I will need a token/authorization or you can confirm and I will attempt to push using the repo context).

If you'd like me to proceed and actually push the README to Gaddamnaresh2654/Gaddamnaresh2654, confirm and I will run the commit action now.
