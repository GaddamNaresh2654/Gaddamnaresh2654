## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub!
I'm a Recent Graduate B.Tech Computer Science student from Hyderabad** , is intrested turning real-world ideas into working AI systems.

## ðŸŒŸ Projects 
**1.AIR QUALITY PREDICTOR USING SENSOR DATA** 
This project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict air quality using real-time sensor data. It takes in environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, and weight, and classifies the air quality into categories like Good, Moderate, or Poor using multiple ML algorithms.
**2.COLOR GAME**
A fun and interactive browser-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where users test their ability to quickly recognize colors.
not by the word shown, but by the color of the text.
The main aim of this project is to develop an engaging browser-based game that tests the player's cognitive speed and focus by challenging them to identify the color of the text, not the word itself. This helps users improve their attention, multitasking, and quick decision-making skills in a fun and interactive way using only HTML, CSS, and JS.
